When asking questions:
• Try to be as direct as you can, instead of `asking to ask` or `asking if there's someone around that has knowledge in X`. 
• Try to provide code, but remove non-relevant code.
When answering questions:
• Try to be informative (why/how).
• If you think someone should not be using X, try to explain why and what are the alternatives.
• If someone still wants to be using X, it's their right. Don't push. "Fair enough" is a good way to end a discussion for everyone. :smile:
